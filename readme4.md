To describe the structure of a web page, we add codes to the words we want to appear on the page. We use HTML codes.
-	 HTML code  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. 
-	Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) 
-	Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
Attributes 
-	provide additional information about the contents of an element. 
-	They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and value, separated by an equals sign. 
-	It should be written in lowercase

HTML5 Layout
HTML5 are  elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
1.	The element < Nav> is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

2.	The element < article>  element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

3.	The element  < aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an element or not. When the element is used inside an element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. When the element is used outside of an element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

4.	The element  < section >  element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. it may contain several distinct elements that have a common theme or purpose.

5.	The element < hgroup > groups together a set of one or more <1> through <6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
