# Text Editor
A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs). Typically, a text editor provides an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixed-line length and visible line numbers. You can then fill the lines in with text, line by line. A special command line lets you move to a new page, scroll forward or backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform other actions. After saving a document, you can then print it or display it. Before printing or displaying it, you may be able to format it for some specific output device or class of output device. Text editors can be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals.

What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some
of the most important features are: 
1. code completion
2. syntax
highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue) 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. 

A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or theclosing of quotation marks when you open them, thus making sure
you’re always writing your code.
Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.
The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice
series of themes. These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
—but there are other themes to choose from as well. Since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time, it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue.
As you become more familiar with coding, you may want to add more
features to your text editor. You’ll want to accomplish more with
minimal effort. You want a text editor that can grow with you as your
needs grow. This comes in the form of extensions. Extensions are like
plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that
you wouldn’t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection
of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality
as you need it
