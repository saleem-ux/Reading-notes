## Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
Operator	Description:
- Equal (==): Returns true if the operands are equal.
- Not equal (!=): Returns true if the operands are not equal.
- Strict equal (===): Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. See also Object.is and sameness in JS.

- Strict not equal (!==): Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.
- Greater than (>): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- Greater than or equal (>=): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- Less than (<): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- Less than or equal (<=): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.


## Logical operators:
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands.
Logical operators:
- Logical AND (&&):
expr1 && expr2 usage.	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
- Logical OR ||:
expr1 or expr2 usage.	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
- Logical NOT (!):
!expr usage.	Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.

## Loops:
Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.
- Java provides three types of loop statements while loops, do-while loops, and for loops:
•	for - loops through a block of code a number of times
•	while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
